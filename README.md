# Electro_Manus
This is the location of my personal project files for my final year in my Computer Science Degree. 
The code that will be kept here will be for the servos that will control the hand. 

The aims:
I aim to create a Python GUI to control the hand and the code for this as I progress through it will all be kept in this repository.
I will also be creating and 3D printing a hand. (these files will be found in a different location, contact me and I will be able to provide them)

History:
I have wanted to create something substantial on the 3D printer for a while. I love the idea of creating prosthetics to help those in need. 
This is a great opportunity for me to test my coding knowledge and see if I can create a basic hand with fingers that are controlled by servos
and a Python GUI controlling those servos. There isn't much of a practical use for this hand, apart from the learning curve it will provide me and others 
if they decide to do likewise. I suppose the hand could be controlled remotely eventually and you could perhaps get the hand to walk? (that's 
a challenge for another day). 
Electro_Manus derives from 'Electro' which is related to electric or electricity and 'Manus' which is Latin for hand.
